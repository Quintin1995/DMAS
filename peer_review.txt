Peer Review:

General:
- Many small grammatical mistakes, such as a missing "s" for plural, etc.
- The paper is already quite long, even though sections still need to be added. Maybe try to be more concise.


Introduction:
- There is no description of what constitutes "civil violence", only mentioning it is a problem, who benefits from learning from it and how simulations help. Give a description first.
- No citations for any of the claims in 1.1 Problem
- The state of the art section is more to describe the performance or conclusions from previous work rather than to describe their modelling techniques, this can be reserved for the methods section. Try to answer: What currently performing best on this topic and why do we want to improve on this?
- In the New Idea subsection, ellaborate on why this is a necesary topic of research.



Method:
- We would recommend not making almost all of the method section bullet points. Some paramters should just be mentioned and not explained in full detail.
- Mabye try to condense the bullet points in the method section into a paragraph or a table perhaps.
- Most parameters explained in the method section have not much to do with the research question. We would recommend being very concise, about paramters that have little to do with the research quesetion.
- Mentioning which kind of plots will be generated by your implemention is not usefull in the method section. Try to only have plots with actual data in them and add them to results and discuss about it in the discussion section.
- We would not recommend a pie-chart, because it is very hard for humans to understand ratio's of surfaces when it comes to circles. Try a different kind of plot. Such as a barplot. 
- There is a GLOBAL PARAMTERS section with a figure (figure 2), try to add more information in the caption of the figure. This caption should explain what we are looking at.
- Each figure should at least be referenced once. Section (implemention details) has a figure with subfigures, each subfigure has a name, a,b,c. These figures should be referenced in the text somewhere.


Results:
- The graphs are really nice and complement your descriptions. Adding axis names would make the graphs a lot more clear.
- Maybe explain what a grievance map is and why it is relevant in this section. Include the new map instead of describing it.
- Explain what your simulation findings mean w.r.t. your research question. Obervations on "The slope of the red curve" don't explain a lot without knowing what the relevance/meaning of the red curve is.
- Explain what you mean by the subsection titles baseline and propaganda effect. It is not immeadiately clear what is meant.
- The barplot that is referred to is a pie chart.
- The final section describes how changing a parameter will influence the results. This should be moved to the discussion.
